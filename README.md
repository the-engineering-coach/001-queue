# TDD for Beginners: Building a Queue in PHP with PHPUnit

This repository contains all the code for the YouTube video tutorial, "TDD for Beginners: Let's Build a Queue from Scratch (PHP & PHPUnit)."

If you're looking to learn Test-Driven Development from a hands-on perspective, this is the perfect place to start. The code follows a strict "Red, Green, Refactor" approach as we build a Queue Abstract Data Type in PHP.

## About the Project
This project is a practical example of how to apply the TDD methodology to a real programming problem. We start with a simple, failing test and build out a complete, robust data structure, one small step at a time. The code is written in PHP and uses the PHPUnit testing framework.

Key concepts explored in the tutorial:

  - The "Red, Green, Refactor" cycle
  - Writing isolated unit tests
  - Using PHPUnit for TDD
  - Refactoring tests and production code
  - Building a Queue data structure

## Getting Started
To run the code and follow along with the tutorial, you'll need PHP and Composer installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/the-engineering-coach/001-queue
cd 001-queue
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```shell
composer install
```

3. Run the tests:

```shell
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

You should see all tests pass! From there, you can experiment with the code or write your own tests to continue learning.
